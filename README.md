## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to identify key factors
that influenced survival rates.

The analysis focuses on **gender, passenger class, age, and fare**, and demonstrates
a complete **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** workflow — from data cleaning to
insight-driven conclusions.

This project was created as part of a **data analysis portfolio** to showcase
practical Python skills and analytical thinking.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare real-world data
- Explore relationships between passenger features and survival
- Communicate insights using clear visualizations
- Produce a reproducible and readable analysis notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Titanic passenger dataset
- Includes demographic, socioeconomic, and survival information
- Widely used for EDA and introductory modeling

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub**

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Women had significantly higher survival rates than men
- Passengers in higher classes were more likely to survive
- Younger passengers showed slightly better survival outcomes
- Fare and passenger class strongly correlate with survival probability
